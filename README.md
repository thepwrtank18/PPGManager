# PPGManager

## what it do
It's an easy place to manage your PPG mods.

For example, instead of manually placing a mod in your Mods folder, you can just drag it into the manager and it will do the work for you (granted the work is 1 moved file but still)

The manager also lets you manage your mods and contraptions, such as deleting and packaging them into a zip file (revolutionary)

## is there anything else
no
