## What does it do?
If you have any external mods/contraptions (not from the Steam Workshop), you can manage those here. Support for Workshop mods pending.<br />
You can also package your mod/contraption in a zip file to share with others.

## How does it work?
### Installation
First, drag a .zip, .rar, or .7z file containing the mod.<br /> 
Note: You want this: <br />![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57580668/153778593-a2ed3748-2baf-4b3c-9cd6-f37754651bfc.png)<br />NOT this: <br />![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57580668/153778750-08bc6a49-c158-4f4b-954c-54d68374bf76.png).

Keep the mod in the root folder.

After that, it will give you a popup: (image)<br />![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57580668/153778523-2984a648-9011-494e-a887-d17a93ed2ecd.png)<br />
and you can choose to install it. If you already installed it, you can delete or reinstall it.

When it's done installing (which should be instant), it will show this: <br />![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57580668/153778905-1468e155-9730-43e2-912f-3b57f13f42b2.png)

### Management
There are 2 buttons, 1 for mods, 1 for contraptions. The following will be looking at mods since it's only slightly different.

Click a mod on the list to find it's options. <br />

From here, you have 3 options: Enabling/disabling (for mods), packaging it, and deleting it. <br />
Note that the Enabled checkbox doesn't work with contraptions, since they are spawned in-game by you, vs a mod.

#### Toggling
Toggle the Enabled checkbox on, and it will be set to on next time you open the game.
Turn it off, it's off.

#### Packaging

Press the Search button to locate a place to save the mod. After that, press Save to save it to that location.

#### Deleting
Deleting will remove the mod from your hard drive. Simple as that.
